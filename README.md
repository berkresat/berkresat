Welcome to **Stars of the sky, Mathpath: Math solver** application development information segment.

**What is the Mathpath: Math solver**

*Mathpath: Math solver is an advanced mathematical solver application that running on Windows and Android platforms. The capability to solve problem are algebra to differential equations, vector fields. And 2D + 3D + Dataset graphs{column-line-dot} displays.* **And it does not need any internet connection to solve problems.**

*Mathpath uses symbolic computing. (below sample image) What is mean?*

*The mean is, really hard to entry on textbox to draw-hand mathematical problems. Therefore a simple way is creating* **"word functions"** *that representing current mathematical notations.* A sample: **diff(** *f(x), x* **)** represent d/dx of f(x) function.

*You see on textbox typed* **x^2+y^2** *but* **[In]** *section converted these symbols automatically to math notation. this process takes ~0.3s.* *Anather sample in below, you see,* **[In] - [Out]** *sections converted quickly math notation and gived answer. (on [Out])*

**A brief story of Mathpath**

When i was studying in Physics, I met powerful symbolic computation **Maple** *Then I decided to develop advanced mathematical solver running on Mobile to reach students free and do not use internet connection.* Then created little group to thrive them about **Python and scientific computing** *future. A few months on summer holiday passed like these. (But some friends gained more experience, not only mathematical solver)  After these holidays I focus more on mathpath solver. Then published demo version to some users (pictures below)*

Some structures like Vector fields algorithm(in below) re-written.

A simple structure to shrink equation font if **[In] and [Out]** labels stacked each of other.

And another summer holiday (just focused holidays and free times) published first versions:

*Mathpath still under developing (by free times)*

**Future of Mathpath**

-AudioMath: Advanced mathematics with sound lost able to sight skill of people.

-PhotoMath: Like Photomath

-Geometry: Angles, Lines, geometric shapes...

**AudioMath** demo is running. Like, you say: **"derivative of x square plus five"** And answer gives as audio: **"two x**

Now I share our sample code as GUI and Backend for if anyone working mathematics with Python-Kivy. I hope this helps developing more scientific tools on mobile and desktop platforms that using Python. When I was studying physics at the college, getting symbolic calculating lesson with Maple software, **it was fascinated me.** 
That the time, I knew Python language as basic. In a while later my scientific computing feelings was soar. I wanted to any student use advanced application (algebra to differential equation) to solve their problems with free and without internet connection. Then I created little group (some still testing or giving feedback) to inspire "thrive spirit"... **Look more info** https://mathpathconsole.github.io/ and on **Google Play Store** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.mathconsole_lite.mathconsole_lite&pli=1

Mathpath uses 3 important Python libraries.

  1- SymPy
  
  2- Matplotlib
  
  3- Kivy and KivyMD

SymPy and Matplotlib for mathematical drivers. Powerful Gui libraries Kivy and KivyMD for screen design. Here is there are sample code each of them in here.

[SymPy source] https://docs.sympy.org/latest/index.html 

[Matplotlib source] https://matplotlib.org/stable/

[Kivy source] https://kivy.org/doc/stable/

**ADVICE and SOLUTION OF ERRORS**
Probably you will take some errors. These errors mostly during compile to .apk or .aab file on buildozer

**Buildozer.spec**

**Edit your buildozer.spec like:**
*# (list) Source files to include (let empty to include all the files)*
*source.include_exts = py,png,jpg,kv,atlas,ttf*
---add ttf or otf---

*# (list) Application requirements*
*# comma separated e.g. requirements = sqlite3,kivy*
*requirements = python3,kivy==2.1.0, kivymd==1.1.1, pillow, sympy, matplotlib*
---add requirements like this---

**1st error: mpmath error!**
Solution is here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/64597102/18110933
Go your current Python file and search 'mpmath' then copy this file and paste (represented file in stackoverflow) in .buildozer

**2nd Advice: SymPy file**
Normally when you compile with current requirements(at over) sympy default version not enough to making mathematics! you got some errors when open your apk file.
you want to try in buildozer.spec requirements sympy==1.10.1 but sometimes this doesn't work. You try manually copy sympy file in computer python files to .buildozer 
like 1st error: mpmath errror! Just your sympy file in computer copy then past your compile apk work: **.buildozer/android/platform/build-armeabi-v7a/dists/<your named file>/_python_bundle__armeabi-v7a/_python_bundle/site-packages/sympy** ->change this sympy file in your computer sympy file version 1.10.1 or more!

[*]look this path: **/build-armeabi-v7a/** this path might be **/build-arm64-v8a/** or different.

then again run **'buildozer android debug deploy run'** in shell. You'll see your apk size increase after added sympy file.

**3rd Advice: monospace font**
if you want to display pretty mathematical symbols, you have to use 'mono space font' find mathematical monospace font then put in current file your .py file location. (I shared an example about it) look example.py and menu_screen.kv file.

That's all. If you want more help these steps you don't hesitate to contact us, we love math and developing scientific tools within Open source.
