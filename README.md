Welcome to Stars of the sky, Mathpath: Math solver application development information segment.

Now I share our sample code as GUI and Backend for if anyone working mathematics with Python-Kivy. I hope this helps developing more scientific tools on mobile and desktop platforms that using Python. When I was studying physics at the college, getting symbolic calculating lesson with Maple software, it was fascinated me. 
That the time, I knew Python language as basic. In a while later my scientific computing feelings was soar. I wanted to any student use advanced application (algebra to differential equation) to solve their problems with free and without internet connection. Then I created little group (some still testing or giving feedback) to inspire "thrive spirit"... Look more info https://mathpathconsole.github.io/

Mathpath uses 3 important Python libraries.
  1- SymPy
  2- Matplotlib
  3- Kivy and KivyMD

SymPy and Matplotlib for mathematical drivers. Powerful Gui libraries Kivy and KivyMD for screen design. Here is there are sample code each of them in here.
